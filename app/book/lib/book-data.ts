 # Understanding

I am only able to write this because i feel that no one is going to read it and i can say anything about my life, that's the only motivation i have.

I am just a <span style="position: relative; display: inline-block;">Normal<span style="position: absolute; top: 50%; left: 0; right: 0; height: 2px; background: currentColor; transform: translateY(-50%);"></span></span> guy who is trying to write about his life experiences and share wounderful weird awkward moments of my life and trust me on this i have a lot of stories to tell.
and its not a clickbate article, i am not trying to sell you anything here, its just about stories of my life.

I am not a good writer, nor am i a good storyteller. 

haven't written any blogs or even my practical files in my life this is a first time for me. 

Just a disclaimer,
I make terrible spelling mistakes and grammatical errors. So, somethings might have to guess what i mean. but i hoping you will get the feeling what i am trying to say.

Let me tell you a bit about myself and where I stand right now.

My name is Yash Siwach, a 21 years old guy who has absolutely no idea what he is doing with his life. 
I completed my Bachelor’s in Computer Applications from Chandigarh University in 2025. After that, 
I joined VIT Vellore for a master’s in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, but I dropped out before the first semester ended.

Now I live with my mother and sister in Zirakpur, doing absolutely nothing.
It’s not that I am dumb or useless. On paper, I look like one of those smart guys who used to run his own web agency during college. 
lived in Gurugram for the last 8 months of my degree, worked in various companies for various roles gaining experience and learning a lot in that short span of time.

Even a week ago my last interviewer, the CEO of a company, told me that I reminded him of manager he had back in the day. and said "you have lot of potential and will do something great in my life."

He offered me a job. I said no.
Why? I still don’t know. Maybe the salary felt too low. Or maybe I was just tired of pretending I knew what I wanted.

And that brings me here.

How did I end up in this place? Why am I writing this? Why am I still here? Why am I even alive?

*"Every story has a beginning. This is where mine starts."*

## The Early Days



I was born in 2004 at a government hospital in Gurugram. It doesn’t exist anymore they shifted it, demolished it, maybe buried my birth certificate with it. 
Now there’s just a gate and a parking lot, like someone deleted the “building” part of life’s code.
